# globus
In this example, we have a div element with the id "globe" that represents the globe image. The CSS code sets the width, height, and background image of the div. The animation property is used to rotate the globe continuously over a duration of 10 seconds using the rotate keyframes animation.

Make sure to replace 'globe.png' with the path to your own globe image file.

Save the code in an HTML file and open it in a web browser. You should see the globe rotating continuously. Adjust the CSS properties and animation duration as needed to achieve the desired effect.
